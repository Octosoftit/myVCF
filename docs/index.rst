Welcome to **myVCF** manual page

myVCF is a user-friendly platform that helps end-users,
without programming skills, to analyze and visualize mutations data
to guide strategies for further downstream analysis.

This tool will help end-users to browse and analyze VCF coming from exome and targeted sequencing projects. myVCF can handle multiple-sample VCF and multiple projects can be created as separate environment in order to manage different VCFs with the same application.

`VCF (Variant Call Format)  <http://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/vcf4.0/>`_ file is the standard format for storing mutation data coming from different sources that used NGS technology (Whole Exome/Genome sequencing, Public database...)
