Welcome to **myVCF** manual page

myVCF is a user-friendly platform that helps end-users, without programming skills, to analyze and visualize mutations in an easy and flexible manner. Helping decision making for further downstream analysis.

myVCF will manage `VCF (Variant Call Format)  <http://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/vcf4.0/>`_ files (the standard format for storing NGS mutations data) deriving from different NGS applications (Whole Exome/Genome sequencing, Public database...)

myVCF will help end-users to browse and analyze VCF coming from exome and targeted sequencing projects. myVCF can handle multiple-sample VCF and multiple projects can be created as separate environment in order to manage different VCFs with the same application.
